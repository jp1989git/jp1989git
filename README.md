- 👋 Hi, I’m Juan Pedro Andrés
- 👀 I’m interested in the progress of human civilization defined as the equality of opportunity, overall human happiness, the end of poverty, quality of our (shared) ecosystems and reduction of footprint, the ending of suffering, and the overall beauty of the human (and sentient) experience.
- I like art and beauty, religions (buddhism in particular), human knowledge and passion, empathy and empathic beings, animals (especially dogs because they are very friendly, but I love all of them), all of life, crystals, chemistry, manhwa and manga, books and libraries, and software and computers obviously.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning automation (physical), physics and chemistry.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on open source machines and factories as a response to humanitarian crises.
- 📫 How to reach me: By e-mail jp1989 (at) gmail
